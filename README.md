# Emotion Detection Using Neural Networks
The project used 2 Convolution Neural Networks to classify the emotion of a person based on an image.

The 2 model architechtures were referenced from the following sources:

https://www.kaggle.com/code/aayushmishra1512/emotion-detector/notebook

To run the code you can either run each cell separately or the whole script. A sample output of the trained data:
